# Learning to DSP, one patch at a time

Various programs and scripts related to audio and digital signal processing.

Of particular interest is the `owl/` subdirectory, which contains patches for the OpenWareLaboratory family of devices.

## Plans for December 2023

1. Read through interesting chapters in the book "Desiging Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by Will Pirkle
2. Implement exercises from the book in Python and C (for the NTS-1)
